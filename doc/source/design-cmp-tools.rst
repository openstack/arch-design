Cloud management architecture
=============================

Complex clouds, in particular hybrid clouds, may require tools to
facilitate working across multiple clouds.

Broker between clouds
 Brokering software evaluates relative costs between different
 cloud platforms. Cloud Management Platforms (CMP)
 allow the designer to determine the right location for the
 workload based on predetermined criteria.

Facilitate orchestration across the clouds
 CMPs simplify the migration of application workloads between
 public, private, and hybrid cloud platforms.

 We recommend using cloud orchestration tools for managing a diverse
 portfolio of systems and applications across multiple cloud platforms.
